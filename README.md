# End-to-End ETL and Executive Dashboard

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL pipeline using SQL Server to ingest, clean, and transform sales data from CSV files into an analytics-ready data mart. An executive Power BI dashboard was built on top of the transformed data to visualize KPIs, trends, and drill-down insights.
